# A Machine Learning-Based Classification and Prediction Technique for DDoS Attacks
Distributed network attacks are referred to, usually, as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks take advantage of specific limitations that apply to any arrangement asset, such asthe framework of the authorized organizations site. In the existing research study, the author worked on an old KDD dataset. It is necessary to work with the latest dataset to identify the current state of DDoS attacks. This paper, used a machine learning approach for DDoS attack types classification and prediction.For this purpose, used Random Forest and XGBoost classi cation algorithms. To access the research proposed a complete framework for DDoS attacks prediction.
# Introduction
Distributed network attacks are referred to, usually, as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. These attacks take advantage of specific limitations that apply to any arrangement asset, such as the framework of the authorized organizations website. A DDoS attack sends different requests (with IP spoo ng) to the target web assets to exceed the sites ability to handle various requests, at a given time, and makethesite unable to operate effectively and ef ciently even for the legitimate users of the network. Typically, the target of various DDoS attacks are web applications and business websites and the attacker may have different goals.
